Hi future Sean,
The issue with the illegal memory access when the simulation runs is 99% caused by the filter_coeffs pointer
pointing aliasing the individual coeff arrays. The solution is to consolidate the filter coeffs into a single
1D array. You will need to rewrite the coeffs allocation and copying, and you will need to calculate the coeff
indexes instead of relying on the 2D array.

Best wishes and good luck,
Past Sean
